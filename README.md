# GrowWithGoogle-Udacity2018

-- 1/22/18 --
This is the unofficial repo for a class project/website created and maintained by the class members of Grow With Google and Udacity 2018.  The boiler plate code has been added.  Feel free to make pull requests at will.  I admit that my experience/knowledge with GitHub is a bit sparse so if you see something that is in need of fixing just let me know :D  Happy coding!
